- Handouts and reports for each lab experiment
- Solutions for each lab (use as reference)
- Circuit diagrams and coding examples

## Important Note
While the solutions are provided for your reference, I encourage you to attempt each experiment on your own at least once. Understanding and debugging the circuits, writing code, and discussing your findings with your teammates and TAs will significantly enhance your learning experience. It may feel tedious at times, but the confidence and clarity you gain from hands-on experience will benefit you in this course and beyond.
